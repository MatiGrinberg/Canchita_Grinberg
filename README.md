# Website project for an Introductory course in HTML & CSS

#### the website represents a business that allows you to rent between multiple locations

* This was the project done in an introductory course of HTML and CSS.
* In it, you can see my creation of different HTML files that represent a renting business website.
* I used CSS files to format my website, including scss and css.map
* And also the use of .gitignore when uploading to Github.
